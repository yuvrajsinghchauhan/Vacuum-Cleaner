# Vacuum-Cleaner
Developed a simple reflex agent program in Python for the vacuum-cleaner world problem.
This program defines the States, Goal State, Goal Test, Actions, Transition Model, and Path
Cost. For each possible initial state, the program returns a sequence of actions that leads to
the goal state, along with the path cost.
